
Bully Algorithm:

- A node on detecting that Leader doesnt respond to its pings starts its election algorithm
- tries to elect itself as a leader
- sends out message, saying if there is any highest PID, respond to me.
- if None,
      sends out elected message saying I am the leader to all nodes.
- if Comes back with a node id, 
      that node takes over, runs the leader election routine.
      

Leader election in a ring:

O(n^2):

- All nodes for a unidirected ring where it communicates to one neighbor.
- Node sends out a message saying this is my current ID to left
- when receive an id j (from the right):
  if j > id then
	forward j to the left (this processor has lost)
  if j = id then
	elect self (this processor has won)
  if j < id then 
	do nothing
